Developed a Java Spring Boot backend for an online hotel room booking system using a Controller-Service-Repository architecture. The system was built and tested on an H2 database with RESTful APIs for room booking, user authentication, and booking management. Postman was used for API testing to ensure seamless functionality and robust error handling, with a focus on efficient data processing, scalability, and easy future integration.
